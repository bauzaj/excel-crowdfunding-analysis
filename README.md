1.	While reviewing the Crowdfunding data, one conclusion we can make is that the goal amount does not seem to be a factor. There are multiple high goal amounts where the success rate outperforms the fail rate. The big three of the entertainment field (films, music, and theater) represent the greatest risk reward in terms of categories, taking a majority of the percent to total for successful and failed funds. The subgroup, theater, is the most volatile section with 55/45 percent split in terms of being successful or not.

2.	 One of the limitations is the lack of attributes and metrics in the raw data. It really limits how you are able to make visualizations to present. 

3.	I would like to see a graph of donations based on weeks / lifespan of a fund. This would help to determine if the first few weeks are critical to a fundsâ€™ success.
